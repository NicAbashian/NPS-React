This application queries through the U.S National Park Service API and returns campground information based on the national park selected.

A user can select a park from a list of national parks in a dropdown. The application will then request campground information from the U.S National Park Service API and display that information in a grid. The user may then sort and filter the campgrounds in the grid.

Once a user selects a campground in the grid, details about that campground will be displayed below along with a button to a reservation site.
